You must have them installed prior to installing gensim.\n\nIt is also recommended you install a fast BLAS library before installing NumPy. This is optional, but using an optimized BLAS such as MKL, ATLAS or OpenBLAS is known to improve performance by as much as an order of magnitude. On OSX, NumPy picks up its vecLib BLAS automatically, so you donâ€™t need to do anything special.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"event_id":"$Iv2XkxkQio3aU3CMcyss7eHWekMcqzpDEB15VZv-SlN","origin_server_ts":1744098752960,"room_id":"!RoBDTr33Tfqa27zzGK:matrix.org","sender":"@gary:gbenson.net","type":"m.room.message","unsigned":{"age":1210}}}
